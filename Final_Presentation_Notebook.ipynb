They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don't know anything about creating movies. We are charged with exploring all sorts of movie industry data such as budget, gross earning, types of genere, moive runtime, release date, etc. We must effectively translate these raw data into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie stduio can use to help decide what type of films to create.\n"
